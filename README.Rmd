# glmsummary

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of glmsummary is to make it easy extracting model coefficients from
generalized linear models and generalized linear mixed models in a tabular 
output that you can then format appropriately per your publication needs.

## Installation

You can install the development version of glmsummary from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Bokola/glmsummary")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, warning=FALSE}
library(glmsummary)
required_pks <- c("gee")
suppressWarnings(install_load_packages(required_pks))
## basic example code

df <- glmsummary::dyme1
# general estimating equations (independent correlation structure)
mfit_1 = gee(rbind(yes, no) ~ dose + weight + litsz + dose2, family = binomial(link = 'logit'),
id = id, corstr = 'independence', data = df)
# general estimating equations (exchangeable correlation structure)
mfit_2 = gee(ord_binary ~ dose + weight + litsz + dose2, family = binomial(link = 'logit'),
id = id, corstr = 'exchangeable', data = df)
# get coefficients
coef_1 <- model_estimates(mfit_1)
names(mtcars)
fit_1 <- lm(mpg ~ cyl + disp, data = mtcars)
model_estimates(fit_1)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
